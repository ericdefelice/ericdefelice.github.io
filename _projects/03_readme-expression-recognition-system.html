    This was my final project for a Digital Image Processing course I took while at Stanford. It is a real-time expression recognition system that detects the users expression by using the angles between various keypoints on the users face. These angles are compared to a baseline "resting" expression of that user. Multiple keypoint detection algorithms were tested and their speed and accuracy were compared. The image processing engine included OpenCV face detection and a cascaded facial keypoint processing pipeline using deformable part models.
