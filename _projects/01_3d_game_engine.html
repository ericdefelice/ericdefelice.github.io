    I am currently working on a 3D action RPG dungeon crawler style game, using my Gumshoe 3D game engine.  The plan is to use this game as a test project to scope out and create the features in the engine.  The main motivation behind the project is to learn about how low level systems in game engines work, and what kind of problems need to be solved to make them work effeciently.

<p>
    With that in mind I started working on the game engine, which I am calling the Gumshoe engine.  "Gumshoe" was my online handle when I played Counter-Strike back around 2001 or so, and it was the first <i>engine-name</i> sounding word that popped into my head.  Having developed some basic systems for the engine (input, sound, graphics, shaders, camera support), I started on the dungeon crawler game as a way to uncover features that the engine should include, and what types of issues need to be solved.

Here is a screenshot of the current status of the game.  Check my blog for updates to this project.  That will probably have more up to date information, and hopefully more in depth discussion.
