I worked on design and development of Montana VR, a football game for the Google Daydream, while working at Superstar Games.  The game is played from a close third-person perspective, giving the player a feel for what it's like to be on the field.  The game includes several NFL players and many different stadium environments to give players a fun, replayable experience.

During the games development, I contributed to engine, gameplay, and AI systems.  Some of my contributions include:
<br>
- Implemented custom in-game movement system to blend physics with estimations to improve performance
<br>
- Wrote shaders to create in-game effects while maintaining required performance
<br>
- Created team-based AI system for more realistic offensive/defensive NPC movement
<br>
- Worked on design and implementation of system to allow for seemless transition from the menu area (locker room) to the game.  The game design allowed this by sending the player down an elevator to get from the locker room to the field.
