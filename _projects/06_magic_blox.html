I worked on design and development of Magic Blox, a block-building game, while working at Superstar Games.  The game features 3 different modes: free-play, puzzle mode and hide n' seek mode.  In free-play mode, players can build anything they like with the blocks and are able to destroy their creations.  Puzzle mode gives players a challenge by showing a structure template that they need to figure out how to fill in.  In Hide n' Seek mode, there is a special block hidden within many structures that the player needs to find before the time runs out.

I led a small team in the design and development of this game.  Some of my contributions include:
<br>
- Created flexible grid system to be able to adapt to the changing play area as a result of AR plane finding
<br>
- Wrote the majority of the game code for UI handling, block placement/deletion, play area finding/generation, and structure destruction mechanics.
<br>
- Implemented procedural puzzle generation algorithms to improve game replay-ability
<br>
- As project lead, I assigned tasks and oversaw the development, leading to a successful product release.
