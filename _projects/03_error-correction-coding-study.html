<p>
This project was done as an independent study during my masters coursework at RIT. The topics that I studied included an overview of the AWGN channel, finite field theory, algebraic coding theory, linear algebraic codes, BCH codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and convolutional & turbo codes.  I wrote papers describing each of the topics and included Matlab simulations showing the implementation of some of the coding schemes.
